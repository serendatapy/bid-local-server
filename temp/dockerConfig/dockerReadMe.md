/*****************************************************/
Shutting Down & Cleaning Up

We don‚Äôt want our image to be running 24/7, but shutting it down can be a little tricky.

In your terminal, press (to persist data)

**ctrl + c**

this may or may not kill the container gracefully ü§∑‚Äç. Either way, run (this will drop tables and start afresh)

**docker-compose down**

afterwards and your container should be shut down. Now you just have to run

**docker-compose up**

again and you‚Äôll be right where you left off.

If you want a fresh start for everything, run

**docker system prune -a**

and

**docker volume prune**

The first command removes any unused containers and the second removes any unused volumes. I recommend doing this fairly often since Docker likes to stash everything away causing the gigabytes to add up.
